Programs Three unique and challenging semester-style programs Through ERA, EAG and EPAi, TSAI has trained more than 7000 students! In ERA we learn how to \"actually\" train LLMs from scratch. EAG focuses on Agents, and EPAi is a comprehensive course focusing on Python and programming for AI! Details - Extensive AI Agents Program EAG - V2 (AI Agents) Registrations are open now! EAG V1 saw our highest enrollment ever! More than 400 students from 15 countries took part in it!. This comprehensive 20-session course equips students to build advanced Agentic AI systems, capable of autonomous decision-making, task orchestration, and seamless interaction within complex web environments. Unlike traditional AI programs, this curriculum focuses on designing browser-based agents that leverage the latest advancements in LLMs, retrieval-augmented systems, and multi-agent collaboration, preparing students to lead the development of next-generation AI solutions. This course does not teach how to use langChain, langGraph, crew.ai or n8n! This course is about making such, and more advanced multi-model Agentic Frameworks and Agents on top of them. The EAG course offers a revolutionary approach to learning AI, enabling students to design agents that mirror human-like intelligence in interacting with the web, bridging the gap between theory and application.Registrations are closed now.
