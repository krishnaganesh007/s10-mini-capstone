It was founded by Chaudhary Raghvendra Singh in 1946, and it is based in New Delhi, India.[2][3] DLF has developed residential colonies in Delhi such as Model Town, Rajouri Garden, Krishna Nagar, South Extension, Greater Kailash, Kailash Colony, and Hauz Khas. DLF builds residential, office, and retail properties.[4][5] With the passage of the Delhi Development Act in 1957, the local government assumed control of real estate development and banned private real estate developers from Delhi proper. As a result, DLF began acquiring land at a relatively low cost outside the area controlled by the Delhi Development Authority, in the district of Gurgaon, and in the adjacent state of Haryana. In the mid-1970s, the company started developing their DLF City project at Gurgaon. This included hotels, infrastructure, and special economic zones-related development projects. The company is headed by Rajiv Singh, who is the current chairman of the DLF Group. According to the Forbes listing of richest billionaires in 2023, Kushal Pal Singh, Chairman Emeritus, is the 19th richest man in India with a net worth of US$8.8 billion. The company's $US$2 billion IPO in July 2007 was India's biggest IPO in history.[6] In its first quarter results for the period ending 30 June 2007, the company reported a turnover of ₹31.2098 billion (US$360 million) and profit after taxes of ₹15.1548 billion (US$180 million).[7] As of 31 March 2012, the company had 1,380 square feet of leased retail space across the country.[8] In 2013-14, it leased out 3 million sq ft of office space in India.[9][10] History DLF's first residential project was Krishna Nagar in East Delhi, which was completed in 1949. Subsequently, the company developed 21 colonies in Delhi, including Model Town, Rajouri Garden, Punjabi Bagh, South Extension, Greater Kailash, Kailash Colony and Hauz Khas. The passage of Delhi Development Act in 1957 was the first serious challenge to company's growth. The Act meant that the government would assume control of all real estate development activities in the city.[11] As a result, DLF decided to move beyond Delhi and focused on the suburb of Gurgaon in Haryana,[12] which had the potential for development of residential and commercial properties. As DLF started to acquire land under the leadership of Chairman K.P. Singh, Gurgaon embarked on a period of rapid growth.[13] A ₹58 crore deal was cancelled between DLF and Robert Vadra by IAS officer Ashok Khemka.[14] Sponsorship In 2008, DLF became the title sponsor of the Indian Premier League, a newly formed Twenty20 cricket league. DLF paid close to ₹2 billion (US$23 million) for the five-year sponsorship deal.[15] The deal ended in the 2012 version of the season, wherein it was taken over by Pepsi. Beyond buildings Haryana Urban Development Authority (HUDA) and DLF, in a 50:50 joint venture, have completed work on a 16-lane, 10.5 km road network in Gurgaon.

This position is corroborated by Go-Auto Private Limited (Go-Auto), the stated supplier of the EVs, which confirmed that it sold 4,704 EVs to the Company for a total consideration of Rs. 567.73 Crore. 27. However, records show that the company received loans aggregating Rs. 663.89 Crore for the stated purpose from IREDA and PFC. Gensol was to provide an additional equity (margin) contribution of 20%, bringing the total expected deployment of approximately Rs. 829.86 Crore for the purchase of 6,400 Electric Vehicles. Based on these figures, an amount of Rs. 262.13 Crore (Rs. 829.86 Crore – Rs. 5 6 7.73 Crore) remains unaccounted, even though more than a year has pas se d since the Company availed the last tranche of the above mentioned financi n g . 28.

DLF builds residential, office, and retail properties.[4][5] With the passage of the Delhi Development Act in 1957, the local government assumed control of real estate development and banned private real estate developers from Delhi proper. As a result, DLF began acquiring land at a relatively low cost outside the area controlled by the Delhi Development Authority, in the district of Gurgaon, and in the adjacent state of Haryana. In the mid-1970s, the company started developing their DLF City project at Gurgaon. This included hotels, infrastructure, and special economic zones-related development projects.

The company's $US$2 billion IPO in July 2007 was India's biggest IPO in history.[6] In its first quarter results for the period ending 30 June 2007, the company reported a turnover of ₹31.2098 billion (US$360 million) and profit after taxes of ₹15.1548 billion (US$180 million).[7] As of 31 March 2012, the company had 1,380 square feet of leased retail space across the country.[8] In 2013-14, it leased out 3 million sq ft of office space in India.[9][10] History DLF's first residential project was Krishna Nagar in East Delhi, which was completed in 1949. Subsequently, the company developed 21 colonies in Delhi, including Model Town, Rajouri Garden, Punjabi Bagh, South Extension, Greater Kailash, Kailash Colony and Hauz Khas. The passage of Delhi Development Act in 1957 was the first serious challenge to company's growth.

As DLF started to acquire land under the leadership of Chairman K.P. Singh, Gurgaon embarked on a period of rapid growth.[13] A ₹58 crore deal was cancelled between DLF and Robert Vadra by IAS officer Ashok Khemka.[14] Sponsorship In 2008, DLF became the title sponsor of the Indian Premier League, a newly formed Twenty20 cricket league.

The complaint was lodged against DLF by buyers in its residential projects Belaire & Park Place, located in Gurgaon.[19] In February 2015, the CCI ordered its investigative arm to probe two more projects of DLF in Gurgaon, namely, DLF Regal Gardens[20] and DLF Skycourt.[21][22] DLF land grab case pertains to the alleged illegal acquisition of 50 acres of land in Amipur village, Haryana, back in 2013, during Bhupinder Singh Hooda's tenure as Chief Minister under the Congress government. This matter has led to an investigation by the Central Bureau of Investigation involving Robert Vadra, Bhupinder Singh Hooda, and the DLF, as of around December 2017.[23]\\n[Source: dlf.md, ID: dlf_1]\", \"DLF Limited (formerly Delhi Land & Finance) is an Indian commercial real estate development company. It was founded by Chaudhary Raghvendra Singh in 1946, and it is based in New Delhi, India.[2][3] DLF has developed residential colonies in Delhi such as Model Town, Rajouri Garden, Krishna Nagar, South Extension, Greater Kailash, Kailash Colony, and Hauz Khas. DLF builds residential, office, and retail properties.[4][5] With the passage of the Delhi Development Act in 1957, the local government assumed control of real estate development and banned private real estate developers from Delhi proper. As a result, DLF began acquiring land at a relatively low cost outside the area controlled by the Delhi Development Authority, in the district of Gurgaon, and in the adjacent state of Haryana. In the mid-1970s, the company started developing their DLF City project at Gurgaon. This included hotels, infrastructure, and special economic zones-related development projects. The company is headed by Rajiv Singh, who is the current chairman of the DLF Group. According to the Forbes listing of richest billionaires in 2023, Kushal Pal Singh, Chairman Emeritus, is the 19th richest man in India with a net worth of US$8.8 billion. The company's $US$2 billion IPO in July 2007 was India's biggest IPO in history.[6] In its first quarter results for the period ending 30 June 2007, the company reported a turnover of ₹31.2098 billion (US$360 million) and profit after taxes of ₹15.1548 billion (US$180 million).[7] As of 31 March 2012, the company had 1,380 square feet of leased retail space across the country.[8] In 2013-14, it leased out 3 million sq ft of office space in India.[9][10] History DLF's first residential project was Krishna Nagar in East Delhi, which was completed in 1949. Subsequently, the company developed 21 colonies in Delhi, including Model Town, Rajouri Garden, Punjabi Bagh, South Extension, Greater Kailash, Kailash Colony and Hauz Khas. The passage of Delhi Development Act in 1957 was the first serious challenge to company's growth. The Act meant that the government would assume control of all real estate development activities in the city.[11] As a result, DLF decided to move beyond Delhi and focused on the suburb of Gurgaon in Haryana,[12] which had the potential for development of residential and commercial properties. As DLF started to acquire land under the leadership of Chairman K.P. Singh, Gurgaon embarked on a period of rapid growth.[13] A ₹58 crore deal was cancelled between DLF and Robert Vadra by IAS officer Ashok Khemka.[14] Sponsorship In 2008, DLF became the title sponsor of the Indian Premier League, a newly formed Twenty20 cricket league. DLF paid close to ₹2 billion (US$23 million) for the five-year sponsorship deal.[15] The deal ended in the 2012 version of the season, wherein it was taken over by Pepsi. Beyond buildings Haryana Urban Development Authority (HUDA) and DLF, in a 50:50 joint venture, have completed work on a 16-lane, 10.5 km road network in Gurgaon.

The complaint was lodged against DLF by buyers in its residential projects Belaire & Park Place, located in Gurgaon.[19] In February 2015, the CCI ordered its investigative arm to probe two more projects of DLF in Gurgaon, namely, DLF Regal Gardens[20] and DLF Skycourt.[21][22] DLF land grab case pertains to the alleged illegal acquisition of 50 acres of land in Amipur village, Haryana, back in 2013, during Bhupinder Singh Hooda's tenure as Chief Minister under the Congress government. This matter has led to an investigation by the Central Bureau of Investigation involving Robert Vadra, Bhupinder Singh Hooda, and the DLF, as of around December 2017.[23]\\n[Source: dlf.md, ID: dlf_1]\", \"DLF Limited (formerly Delhi Land & Finance) is an Indian commercial real estate development company. It was founded by Chaudhary Raghvendra Singh in 1946, and it is based in New Delhi, India.[2][3] DLF has developed residential colonies in Delhi such as Model Town, Rajouri Garden, Krishna Nagar, South Extension, Greater Kailash, Kailash Colony, and Hauz Khas. DLF builds residential, office, and retail properties.[4][5] With the passage of the Delhi Development Act in 1957, the local government assumed control of real estate development and banned private real estate developers from Delhi proper. As a result, DLF began acquiring land at a relatively low cost outside the area controlled by the Delhi Development Authority, in the district of Gurgaon, and in the adjacent state of Haryana. In the mid-1970s, the company started developing their DLF City project at Gurgaon. This included hotels, infrastructure, and special economic zones-related development projects. The company is headed by Rajiv Singh, who is the current chairman of the DLF Group. According to the Forbes listing of richest billionaires in 2023, Kushal Pal Singh, Chairman Emeritus, is the 19th richest man in India with a net worth of US$8.8 billion. The company's $US$2 billion IPO in July 2007 was India's biggest IPO in history.[6] In its first quarter results for the period ending 30 June 2007, the company reported a turnover of ₹31.2098 billion (US$360 million) and profit after taxes of ₹15.1548 billion (US$180 million).[7] As of 31 March 2012, the company had 1,380 square feet of leased retail space across the country.[8] In 2013-14, it leased out 3 million sq ft of office space in India.[9][10] History DLF's first residential project was Krishna Nagar in East Delhi, which was completed in 1949. Subsequently, the company developed 21 colonies in Delhi, including Model Town, Rajouri Garden, Punjabi Bagh, South Extension, Greater Kailash, Kailash Colony and Hauz Khas. The passage of Delhi Development Act in 1957 was the first serious challenge to company's growth. The Act meant that the government would assume control of all real estate development activities in the city.[11] As a result, DLF decided to move beyond Delhi and focused on the suburb of Gurgaon in Haryana,[12] which had the potential for development of residential and commercial properties. As DLF started to acquire land under the leadership of Chairman K.P. Singh, Gurgaon embarked on a period of rapid growth.[13] A ₹58 crore deal was cancelled between DLF and Robert Vadra by IAS officer Ashok Khemka.[14] Sponsorship In 2008, DLF became the title sponsor of the Indian Premier League, a newly formed Twenty20 cricket league. DLF paid close to ₹2 billion (US$23 million) for the five-year sponsorship deal.[15] The deal ended in the 2012 version of the season, wherein it was taken over by Pepsi. Beyond buildings Haryana Urban Development Authority (HUDA) and DLF, in a 50:50 joint venture, have completed work on a 16-lane, 10.5 km road network in Gurgaon. This stretch from NH8 Toll Plaza to Sector 55/56 in Gurgaon with six underpasses, one flyover and freeways has improved traffic management in the city.[16] To create this\\n[Source: dlf.md, ID: dlf_0]\", 'Jaggi and Puneet Singh Jaggi are / were promoter Directors.|Yes| |8.|Gensol Ventures Private Limited|Part of the promoter group of Gensol|Yes| |9.|Gensol EV Lease Private Limited|Subsidiary(Gensol held 88.21% of the company)|Yes| ***Loan for Rs. 71.41 Crore from IREDA (Serial No. 3 in the Table under Para 24)*** ### 31.

On the same day, the Company transferred promoter contribution of Rs. 26.06 Crore from another internal account into the above Trust and Retention Account. The total funds credited in the said account amounted to Rs. 97.46 Crore. 33. On October 03, 2022, Rs. 93.88 Crore was transferred from the Trust and Retention Account to Go-Auto (Bank A/c No. 06792000003065 with HDFC Bank). Prior to this transfer, the balance in the said account of Go-Auto was Rs. 0.79 Crore. It was noted that immediately upon receipt of the said amount, Go- Auto, on the same day, transferred Rs. 50 Crore to Capbridge (Bank A/c No. 920020064107731 with Axis Bank), a disclosed related party of Gensol. The Capbridge account had a balance of Rs. 0.15 Crore prior to this transaction. 34. On October 06, 2022, it was noted that Capbridge transferred Rs. 42.94 Crore to DLF Limited (DLF). As per information provided by DLF (email dated December 17, 2024), the above payment was made towards consideration for the purchase of an apartment in the project The Camellias . The submissions made by DLF Ltd. are summarised below: (a) On September 29, 2022, a sum of Rs. 5 Crore was paid to DLF by Jasminder Kaur, as advance, for booking an apartment in the project The Camellias . (b) On October 06, 2022, Capbridge paid Rs. 42.94 Crore to DLF as part of the consideration for the above apartment booked by Jasminder Kaur. (c) On October 20, 2022, the allotment was formally made to Jasminder Kaur. (d) Thereafter, on request, the allotment was substituted in favour of Capbridge.

This position is corroborated by Go-Auto Private Limited (Go-Auto), the stated supplier of the EVs, which confirmed that it sold 4,704 EVs to the Company for a total consideration of Rs. 567.73 Crore. 27. However, records show that the company received loans aggregating Rs. 663.89 Crore for the stated purpose from IREDA and PFC. Gensol was to provide an additional equity (margin) contribution of 20%, bringing the total expected deployment of approximately Rs. 829.86 Crore for the purchase of 6,400 Electric Vehicles. Based on these figures, an amount of Rs. 262.13 Crore (Rs. 829.86 Crore – Rs. 5 6 7.73 Crore) remains unaccounted, even though more than a year has pas se d since the Company availed the last tranche of the above mentioned financi n g . 28. Given the above, to understand the end-use of funds, bank statements of both the Company and the dealer, Go-Auto, were examined. The analysis showed that once the funds were transferred from Gensol to Go-Auto, ostensibly for the purchase of EVs, they were, in most of the instances, either transferred back to the Company itself or routed to entities that were directly or indirectly related to Anmol Singh Jaggi and Puneet Singh Jaggi, promoters and directors of Gensol. 29.
