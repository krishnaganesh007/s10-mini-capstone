It comprises 4 BHK, 5 BHK, and 6 BHK luxury apartments. Prices for these upscale homes begin at Rs 70 crore.\n\n**Image:** [Image file not found: https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202504/anmol-jaggi--co-founder--blusmart-at-his-residence-in-gurgaon-on-27122023-photo-by-hardik-chhabra-164710471-16x9_0.jpg?VersionId=4SfzpX.COhBosIXMjB_7M4k_znuWyK14&size=690:388]\n\nThe DLF Camellias apartment, one of Gurgaon's and possibly India's most elite addresses, is now at the centre of a Sebi investigation that has exposed serious cracks in corporate governance at Gensol Engineering.\n\nThe market regulator’s interim order reveals that Anmol Singh Jaggi, one of Gensol’s promoters, allegedly used company funds, including loans meant for electric vehicle purchases, to quietly finance a high-end apartment in the ultra-luxury project in Gurgaon.\n\nDLF Camellias is a luxury housing project located in Sector 42, Gurgaon. It features 429 high-end residences, available in 4 BHK, 5 BHK, and 6 BHK layouts. According to the official website, prices for these upscale homes begin at Rs 70 crore.\n\n### MONEY MEANT FOR EVs USED TO BUY LUXURY FLAT\n\nGensol had taken a loan of Rs 71.41 crore from the Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency (IREDA), and added another Rs 26 crore from its own account. This brought the total to nearly Rs 97 crore. A few days later, this money was sent to Go-Auto, a car dealer with links to the company and its promoters.\n\nOn the very same day, Go-Auto transferred Rs 50 crore to another entity, Capbridge Ventures, which is run by the Jaggi brothers who are promoters of Gensol. Capbridge Ventures then used Rs 42.94 crore to pay DLF towards the purchase of an apartment in The Camellias project.\n\nSebi said this was a clear case of fund diversion. The loans taken for EV leasing were being rerouted to a real estate deal by passing the money through related parties. The apartment, according to Sebi, was bought in the name of a firm where Anmol Singh Jaggi and his brother Puneet Singh Jaggi are both designated partners.\n\n### BOOKING ADVANCE ALSO LINKED TO GENSOL FUNDS\n\nThe chain of transactions did not end there. Sebi also found that Rs 5 crore was paid as an initial booking advance for the apartment by Jasminder Kaur, the mother of Anmol Singh Jaggi. This money, too, came from Gensol.\n\nLater, when DLF returned the advance amount to her, the money did not go back to Gensol. Instead, it was transferred to another related company, Matrix Gas and Renewables. Sebi’s investigation shows that there was no intention to return the company’s money.\n\nIn a written response to Sebi, DLF confirmed that a payment of Rs 42.94 crore was made on October 6, 2022, towards the purchase of an apartment. This apartment was originally booked in the name of Jasminder Kaur.\n\n### SEBI TAKES ACTION\n\nAfter completing its investigation, Sebi has passed an interim order against Gensol Engineering and its promoters — Anmol Singh Jaggi and Puneet Singh Jaggi. The regulator has barred all three from trading in the capital markets until further notice.\n\nIt has also banned the two brothers from serving as directors or holding any senior roles at Gensol. In its order, Sebi said, “The promoters were running a listed public company as if it were a proprietary firm.” The regulator added that there was a complete breakdown of internal financial checks and proper governance in the company.\n\n### BACKGROUND OF THE CASE\n\nSebi had started its investigation after getting complaints about Gensol. These included concerns over sharp movements in share prices and defaults in loan payments. During the probe, Sebi found that Gensol’s promoters had moved large amounts of borrowed money through related companies and used it for personal gain.\n\nThe misuse was not limited to the DLF apartment purchase. Sebi said there were several examples of fund diversion, which included fake documents, misreporting to credit agencies, and lack of financial discipline.\n\nSebi’s order said the company’s funds were treated like the promoters’ personal account and were used for purposes that had nothing to do with the company's business.\n\nSebi has also directed Gensol to stop its proposed stock split, saying that such a move could attract more small investors at a time when serious issues remain unresolved. The regulator will appoint a forensic auditor to go through the company’s books and look into transactions with related entities.\n\nMeanwhile, Gensol and its promoters will not be allowed to buy or sell shares in the market. They can only close open trading positions if any, within a limited time. There is no timeline yet for when the restrictions might be lifted.",

The market regulator’s move follows allegations of financial misconduct, including diversion of funds intended for the purchase of electric vehicles and corporate governance lapses, reported Business Today.\n\n**Image:** [Image file not found: https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2025/04/16/550x309/Anmol_Singh_Jaggi_1744769229981_1744769230301.jpg]\n\nFurther, the markets watchdog directed Gensol Engineering Ltd (GEL) to put on hold the stock split announced by it.\n\n## Company funds for personal use\n\nAccording to the SEBI order, Anmol Singh Jaggi and Puneet Singh Jaggi diverted company loans for personal use - including the purchase of luxury real estate in Gurgaon.\n\nSebi noted that the promoters were running a listed public company as if it were a propriety firm. GEL's funds were routed to related parties and used for unconnected expenses as if the company's funds were promoters' piggy banks.\n\nIn a 29-page interim order, Sebi said, \"The prima facie findings have shown mis-utilisation and diversion of funds of the company (GEL) in a fraudulent manner by its promoter directors, Anmol Singh Jaggi and Puneet Singh Jaggi, who are also the direct beneficiaries of the diverted funds\".\n\n## How funds were misused\n\nAs per SEBI’s interim order published Tuesday, an amount of ₹42.94 crore from a larger loan secured by Gensol was ultimately channelled through Capbridge Ventures – a firm controlled by promoter Anmol Singh Jaggi – to finance the purchase of a luxury apartment in DLF Camellias.\n\nJaggi also used ₹50 lakh from the funds to invest in Ashneer Grover’s startup, Third Unicorn.\n\nAn amount of ₹6.20 crore was diverted to Anmol Singh Jaggi’s mother, while his wife received ₹2.98 crore. He allegedly spent ₹26 lakh on a golf set and ₹3 lakh on MakeMyTrip for personal travel.\n\nThe result of these transactions would mean that the diversions at some time need to be written off from Gensol's books, ultimately resulting in losses to the investors of the company.\n\n\"...prima facie evidence of a blatant violation of rules of corporate governance is writ large over the workings of the company. The diversion of funds of the company (GEL) by promoter entities reflects a culture of weak internal control, where even ring-fenced borrowings from institutional creditors were rerouted at the total discretion of the promoters,\" Sebi's whole-time member Ashwani Bhatia said in the order.\n\n*(With inputs from PTI)*",

Investigators traced ₹42.94 crore from Capbridge Ventures LLP, a company where both Anmol and Puneet Singh Jaggi are designated partners, to a payment made to DLF for an apartment in “The Camellias” project. SEBI noted that the apartment was initially booked in the name of the promoter's mother, Jasminder Kaur, with a ₹5 crore advance, which was later refunded and replaced by Capbridge as the final buyer.\n\nSEBI found that the funds originated from Gensol itself, passed through its vendor Go-Auto and related entities, before reaching DLF.\n\nFurther, the ₹5 crore booking advance was itself sourced from Gensol’s own funds via multiple related parties, and once DLF refunded it, the amount was rerouted to another related entity—Matrix Gas and Renewables. “These transactions demonstrate layered fund flows to disguise personal asset acquisition using public company funds,” SEBI stated.\n\nThe transaction, routed through a promoter-linked entity, forms a central part of SEBI’s probe into alleged financial irregularities, fund diversion, and corporate mis-governance at the listed firm.\n\nETRealty has reached out to DLF and will update the story based on the responses received.\n\nSeveral high-profile individuals have bought apartments in DLF Camellias over the years. Smiti Agarwal, wife of Hemant Agarwal, CMD of V-Bazaar Retail, had bought a 10,800 sq ft apartment for Rs 95 crore while Info-x Software Technology, through its director Rishi Parti, had bought a 16,000 sq ft for ₹190 crore.\n\nLenskart founder Peyush Bansal had purchased a 7,461 sq. ft luxury apartment for Rs 27.02 crore while Dhanuka Agritech's group chairman Ram Gopal Agarwal and his wife Urmila Dhanuka bought 7,361 sq ft apartment for Rs 22.55 crore.\n\n**Wider investigation on Gensol**\n\nSEBI’s wider investigation shows that Gensol borrowed over ₹977 crore from institutions such as IREDA and PFC, primarily for procuring 6,400 electric vehicles. Only 4,704 were acquired, costing ₹567.73 crore. Nearly ₹262 crore remains unaccounted. Funds meant for asset procurement were allegedly misappropriated through Go-Auto and channeled to multiple promoter-related entities, including Capbridge, Gensol Ventures, and Wellray Solar Industries.\n\nThe regulator noted a “complete breakdown of corporate governance” at Gensol, where promoters used the company’s resources as a personal piggy bank—funding family members, purchasing luxury real estate, and engaging in speculative trading in Gensol’s own shares via Wellray Solar.\n\nSEBI has barred Anmol and Puneet Singh Jaggi from acting as directors or key managerial personnel in Gensol and prohibited all three noticees—Gensol, Anmol, and Puneet—from trading in the securities market. A planned 1:10 stock split has also been frozen to protect investors.\n\nFurther, a forensic audit has been ordered to examine financial records of Gensol and its related entities. SEBI also cited misleading disclosures by Gensol, including exaggerated claims of EV orders and strategic tie-ups, none of which were backed by binding contracts or financial rationale.\n\nThe regulator has warned retail investors to exercise caution, especially in light of the potential for promoters to offload remaining stakes and erode value further.",

The market regulator’s move follows allegations of financial misconduct, including diversion of funds intended for the purchase of electric vehicles and corporate governance lapses, reported Business Today.\n\n**Image:** [Image file not found: https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2025/04/16/550x309/Anmol_Singh_Jaggi_1744769229981_1744769230301.jpg]\n\nFurther, the markets watchdog directed Gensol Engineering Ltd (GEL) to put on hold the stock split announced by it.\n\n## Company funds for personal use\n\nAccording to the SEBI order, Anmol Singh Jaggi and Puneet Singh Jaggi diverted company loans for personal use - including the purchase of luxury real estate in Gurgaon.\n\nSebi noted that the promoters were running a listed public company as if it were a propriety firm. GEL's funds were routed to related parties and used for unconnected expenses as if the company's funds were promoters' piggy banks.\n\nIn a 29-page interim order, Sebi said, \"The prima facie findings have shown mis-utilisation and diversion of funds of the company (GEL) in a fraudulent manner by its promoter directors, Anmol Singh Jaggi and Puneet Singh Jaggi, who are also the direct beneficiaries of the diverted funds\".\n\n## How funds were misused\n\nAs per SEBI’s interim order published Tuesday, an amount of ₹42.94 crore from a larger loan secured by Gensol was ultimately channelled through Capbridge Ventures – a firm controlled by promoter Anmol Singh Jaggi – to finance the purchase of a luxury apartment in DLF Camellias.\n\nJaggi also used ₹50 lakh from the funds to invest in Ashneer Grover’s startup, Third Unicorn.\n\nAn amount of ₹6.20 crore was diverted to Anmol Singh Jaggi’s mother, while his wife received ₹2.98 crore. He allegedly spent ₹26 lakh on a golf set and ₹3 lakh on MakeMyTrip for personal travel.\n\nThe result of these transactions would mean that the diversions at some time need to be written off from Gensol's books, ultimately resulting in losses to the investors of the company.\n\n\"...prima facie evidence of a blatant violation of rules of corporate governance is writ large over the workings of the company. The diversion of funds of the company (GEL) by promoter entities reflects a culture of weak internal control, where even ring-fenced borrowings from institutional creditors were rerouted at the total discretion of the promoters,\" Sebi's whole-time member Ashwani Bhatia said in the order.\n\n*(With inputs from PTI)*",
